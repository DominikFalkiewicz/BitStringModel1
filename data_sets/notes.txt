The model returns 3 types of data:

-Bitmap depicting population at the final time step of the
simulation. How the images are generated was descibed in the
article and can be easly deduced from source code in code/model
directory.

-Text file containing data about population in the final time step
of the simulation. This includes genomes of all living organisms.
--Rows of the simulation grid are separated by collons in old
version and new lines in current version.
--Fields are separated by semicollons.
--Empty fields are represented by 'X'.
--Organisms are represented by two strings of zeros and ones
separaded by comma.

-Current number of organisms is appened to a text firl that can be
used to look at population growth in several simulations with
diferent parameters.
--At each time step numebr of organisms currently alife is appened
followe by comma.
--If no organisms are alife 'X;' is appended in old version and 
'X\n' is appended in new version. Simulation is then restarted.
--At each of the simmuations succesfully finnished semicollon is
appended in the old version and new line is appended in the new
version.

Output had been changed due to technical difficulties. Data
presented here is generated in old output while code is set to
generate new output.

500_steps_1000_grid.zip contains data from 5 sets of simulations
including population files corresponding to them. Simulations
were conducted on 1000x1000 grid and lasted 500 time steps.

20000_steps_250_grid.zip contains data from 5 sets of simulations
without population files. Simulations were conduced on 250x250 grid
and lasted 20000 time steps. This data is used in the article.

Each file name in form A_B_CCC.xxx indicates parameters used in the
simulation. A indicates C, B indicates F and CCC indicates R.

For each simulation D=0.02, G=64, M=1.
